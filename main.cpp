     * 2) in HashMap.cpp, write the constructors for hashMap, the addKeyAndValue, the getIndex,
     *    insertNewKeyandValue, and dealWithCollisions (as defined in hashMap.cpp).
     * 3) once you have these working, you can test the following code and you should get exactly the

    /* Test 3
     * This is challenging.  When a hashMap gets too full, there are too many collisions for it to
     * be efficient any more.  That magic fullness number is 70%.  So you want to write the method
     * ckIfNeedToRehash() (which is called in the insertNewKeyandValue method ).
     * the ckIfNeedToRehash method checks if the map is 70% full, and, if so, calls the reHash method
     * which is somewhat challenging and requires a good understanding of pointers so that you don't
     * lose the map, don't rehash into the wrong map, and don't use the wrong table size when you're
     * rehashing.  I've included more detailed instructions in hashMap.cpp.
     * When you have it working, uncomment out the following lines of code and test your rehash method.
     * Since you're still using my set in stone hash function and collision function, you should get
     * the exact output I've included below the main under Test 3
     * For the rehash method, you may wish to write the findKeyIndex method.  We'll be using
     * it later in the writeFile method, but it might come in useful in the reHash method as
     * well.
     * */
     k = new voice("MedGEaH.txt","SecondTestOut.txt", hashfn, collfn);
     k->readFile();

     /* End of test 3*/
 /* Part 4:
  * from now on I can't give you definitive output because it depends on what hashing function you write and what
  * collision function you write.
  * I am giving you the steps for how I'd approach this
  * Write your first hashing function.
  * delete k;
  * Test your hashing function with:
  * hashfn = 2;
  * k = new voice("ShortGEaH.txt","FirstTestOut.txt", hashfn, collfn);
    k->readFile();
    k->ht->printMap();
  * If that works, try it with the larger data set:
  * delete k;
  * k = new voice("MedGEaH.txt","FirstTestOut.txt", hashfn, collfn);
    k->readFile();
    k->ht->printMap();

    If all of this works, write your second hashing function and repeat from delete k down to the print map,
    only set hashfn to 3;

    Once you have all this working, switch the hashfn to 1, and the collfn to 2, and then write your first
    collision function
    delete the old map (k)
    and read in the short text file  for testing. (steps are the same as above)

    Then test on the MedGEaH text file

    THen write your second collision function, switch collfn to 3, and test your second collision function
    on the ShortGEaH text file.

    Then on the MedGEaH text file.

    THen test the 4 permutations:
    hashfn = 2, collfn = 2; hashfn = 2, collfn = 3; hashfn = 3, collfn = 2; hashfn = 3, collfn = 3;

    When you've got all that working, add in a call to
    k->writeFile();

    And, once that's working:
    add the following code:
    k = new voice("DrSeuss.txt","SeussOut2_2.txt", 2, 2);
    k->readFile();
    k->writeFile();
    delete k;
    k = new voice("DrSeuss.txt","SeussOut3_2.txt", 3, 2);
    delete k;
    k = new voice("DrSeuss.txt","SeussOut2_3.txt", 2, 3);
    delete k;
    k = new voice("DrSeuss.txt","SeussOut3_3.txt", 3, 3);
  *
  *I'm including my SeussOut1_1.txt at the very bottom
  */
 delete k;
 k = new voice("DrSeuss.txt","SeussOut1_1.txt", 1, 1);
 k->readFile();
 k->writeFile();
    return 0;
